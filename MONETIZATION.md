# formik-migrate - Simple Monetization

## The Model: Donations Only

**100% free tool. Optional tips.**

### How It Works:

1. **Tool is completely free**
   - No paywalls
   - No feature restrictions
   - No subscriptions
   - Fully open source

2. **After it saves someone time:**
   - Show friendly message: "Saved you 8 hours? Buy me a coffee!"
   - Link to: https://buymeacoffee.com/willzhangfly
   - Suggested: $2-5 one-time tip

3. **That's it!**

---

## Why This Works:

✅ **Low barrier** - people actually use it  
✅ **Goodwill** - they want to support you after it helps  
✅ **Scalable** - 10,000 users × 3% tip rate × $3 = $900  
✅ **Simple** - no billing, no dashboards, no support burden  

---

## Expected Revenue:

**Conservative:**
- 1,000 downloads in Month 1
- 2% tip ($3 avg)
- = $60

**Realistic:**
- 5,000 downloads by Month 3
- 3% tip ($3 avg)
- = $450

**Optimistic:**
- 20,000 downloads by Month 6
- 5% tip ($4 avg)
- = $4,000

---

## Setup Steps:

1. **Create Buy Me a Coffee account**
   - Go to: https://buymeacoffee.com/signup
   - Username: `willzhangfly`
   - Set price: $3 default (people can pay more)

2. **Already added to:**
   - ✅ README.md
   - ✅ CLI output (after successful migration)
   - ✅ GitHub repo

3. **That's it!**

---

## Future Options (If It Gets Big):

**If you hit 50,000+ downloads:**
- GitHub Sponsors (recurring donations)
- Offer paid consulting ($200/hr for complex migrations)
- Create a course: "Mastering React Hook Form"

**But for now:** Keep it simple. Just donations.
